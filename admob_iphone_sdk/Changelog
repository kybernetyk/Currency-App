Version: 2009-04-02
--------------------
* Added a version method to AdMobView to be able easily determine the version of the binary.
* Added the ability for AdMob to display messages (e.g. notifications of SDK updates) in your Xcode debug console, when using the Simulator only.
* Added support for a click-to-contacts ad unit.
* Location is only ascertained once every 24 hours (instead of every 5 minutes) to conserve CPU and battery.
* User is shown a dialog before making a click-to-call phone call to prevent accidental phone calls.
* i18n: translation support for all strings present in the AdMob SDK. Will initially support the same languages as www.admob.com.
* Fixed: Dismissing an embedded browser when the keyboard is up no longer causes a crash. (This is actually a workaround
  a UIWebView bug.) Thanks to Aaron Miller for the bug report.
* Minor documentation clarifications.

Version: 2009-02-03
--------------------
* Added no thumb device build.
* Fixed: When a transform was applied to an AdMobView, touch detection did not occur correctly.
  IMPORTANT: If you are applying transforms to your AdMobView, this fix may cause the ad to render in a different
  location than it used to! Please double check your ad placement!
* Fixed: Under rare race conditions, rogue timers could in theory cause crashes. (No reports of this occurring, just being careful.)
* Code cleanup to prevent URL download memory leaks. (None actually occur with code as it exists, just do things right so they don't arise in the future.)
* Fixed: Location updating code was not always respecting cache ttls.
* Improved AppStore/iTunes link detection in embedded browser.
* Fixed: If the AdMobView was released while a user was using the embedded browser, some actions would cause a crash.
* Tweaked the UI of the embedded browser to better follow Apple HIGs.
* Sometimes on the simulator a UUID is not available -- handle that more gracefully.
* Started changelog. :)
